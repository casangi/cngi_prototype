# About this Project
This is a rapid prototype development effort underway by members of the Common Astronomy Software Applications 
(CASA) team at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO).  
  
[https://casa.nrao.edu](https://casa.nrao.edu)

The CASA team has begun exploring options for a new generation of software to meet the growing demands of current and future instruments. 
This **cngi_prototype** package is a demonstration of the current state of our research efforts.  Its primary purpose is to showcase
new data structures for MeasurementSet and Image contents built entirely in Python atop the popular technology stack of numpy, dask, 
and xarray. A selection of core mathematics, manipulation, middleware and analysis functions are shown to demonstrate the simplicity and
scalability of the technology choices. Finally, the most compute intensive areas of CASA imaging are implemented and benchmarked to
demonstrate the parallel scalability and raw performance now possible from a pure-Python software stack.


This software is subject to change without notice. It has not been thoroughly tested or verified and should be
considered demonstration only. An official release under a different name is planned for the future, at which time more 
rigorous testing and change control/communication will be in place.
