However, it is more efficient for the Dask chunk size to be equal to or a multiple of the Zarr chunk size (to stop multiple reads of the same data). This hierarchy of chunking allows for flexible and efficient algorithm development. For example cube imaging is more memory efficient if chunking is along the channel axis (the [benchmarking](https://ngcasa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/benchmark.html) example demonstrates this).

        "The `vis.zarr` format is an expression of the MeasurementSet (MS) specification that replaces the CASA table system with the Zarr N-dimensional array framework. For example the Data data variable (contains the visibilities) is a four dimensional array with axes `time`, `baseline`, `chan`, `pol`. The `vis.zarr` is different from the other Zarr formats in that it is a group of xarray datasets, not just one. Multiple datasets arise since the dimensions of different polarization and spectral window setups differ. The data description identifier (ddi) provides an index that combines the spectral window identifier and polarization identifier. The idea of ddi comes from the [MSv2](https://casacore.github.io/casacore-notes/229.pdf) definition ([ms v3](https://casacore.github.io/casacore-notes/264.pdf) deprecates this).

The data variables in the output dataset are associated with task graphs. Compute is only triggered when the user explicitly calls compute on the Xarray dataset or instructs an ngCASA function to save to disk. The term flat means that the functions are not allowed to call each other, and the term stateless means that they many not access any global data outside the parameter list, nor maintain any persistent internal data. There is one exception, for parameter default values that live in the parameter checking files of each module.\n",

However, it is more efficient for the dask chunk size to be equal to or a multiple of the zarr chunk size (to stop multiple reads of the same data). This hierarchy of chunking allows for flexible and efficient algorithm development. For example cube imaging is more memory efficient if chunking is along the channel axis (the [benchmarking](https://ngcasa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/benchmark.html) example demonstrates this). Note, chunking can be done in any combination of dimensions.\n",

Some algorithms must be done on each dataset (or subset) separately, whereas others are to be done on an entire set. Current CASA6 has a mix of both the following and this is a significant source of inconsistency. Can the new framework simplify any book-keeping for this use-case without sacrificing other aspects such as performance ?\n",

Algorithms such as imaging can view it as a single large dataset. However, for some algorithms (such as calibration solutions that must pay attention to different meta-data across subsets) the internal diversity will still have to be managed through loops inside the methods.\n",
