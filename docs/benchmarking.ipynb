    "\n",
    "Measurement of runtime performance for the component typically dominating compute cost for existing and future workflows -- the [major cycle](https://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs/casa-5.4.1/global-task-list/task_tclean/about) -- was made against the reference implementation of CASA 6.2. Relevant calls of the CASA task `tclean` were isolated for direct comparison with the latest version of the `cngi-prototype` implementation of the mosaic and standard gridders.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps of the workflow used to prepare data for testing were:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download archive data from ALMA Archive\n",
    "2. Restore calibrated MeasurementSet using scriptForPI.py with compatible version of CASA\n",
    "3. Split off science targets and representative spectral window into a single MeasurementSet\n",
    "4. Convert calibrated MeasurementSet into zarr format using `cngi.conversion.convert_ms`\n",
    "\n",
    "This allowed for generation of image data from visibilities for comparison. Tests were run in two different environments:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. On premises using the same high performance computing (HPC) cluster environment used for offline processing of data from North American [ALMA](https://science.nrao.edu/facilities/alma/facilities/alma) operations.\n",
    "2. Using commercial cloud resources furnished by Amazon Web Services ([AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/))."

    "The total runtime of the prototype has comparable performance to the CASA 6.2 reference implementations for all datasets. There does not appear to be a performance penalty associated with adopting a pure Python framework compared to the compiled C++/Fortran reference implementation. This is likely due largely to the prototype's reliance on the `numba` Just-In-Time (JIT) transpiler, and the C foreign function interface relied on by third-party framework packages including `numpy` and `scipy`.\n",

One contributing factor that likely dominated this effect was the use of [preemptible instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-interruptions.html) underlying the compute nodes running the worker configuration. For this same reason, some cloud-based test runs show decreased performance with increased scale. This is due to the preemption of nodes and associated redeployment by kubernetes, which sometimes constituted a large fraction of the total test runtime, as demonstrated by the task stream for the following test case. Note the horizontal white bar (signifying to tasks executed) shortly after graph execution begins, as well as some final tasks being assigned to a new node that came online after a few minutes (represented by the new \"bar\" of 8 rows at top right) in the following figure:\n",
